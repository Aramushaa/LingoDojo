# LingoDojo Pack Guidance (Teacher + Product Notes)

## High-level verdict
- Situation-first packs (airport, hotel) are correct.
- A1 → A2 → B1 progression is strong.
- Dark Mode is valuable for comprehension, not production.

## Quality improvements applied
- Dark Mode cards now include explicit safety cues:
  - `trap`: why the phrase is risky
  - `cultural_note`: how tone is perceived
  - `native_sauce`: safer alternative phrasing

## Pack structure (recommended)
Each pack should feel like a mission with internal phases:
1) Recognition (low pressure)
2) Controlled production (slot-fill)
3) Mission/roleplay (goal-driven)

## Missing micro-skills (now addressed)
Add pack types that improve naturalness:
- Response Glue (short replies: “Capisco.” “Perfetto.”)
- Politeness Modulators (softeners: “Per cortesia.” “Se possibile.”)

## Redundancy control
- Avoid multiple variants of the same intent in the same A1 pack.
- If variants are useful, move them to A2 glue or store as examples.

## A1/A2/B1 intent boundaries
- A1: survival + immediate action, short forms.
- A2: explanations, apologies, rebooking, announcements.
- B1: pressure, negotiation, disputes, authority language.
- Dark Mode: recognition only, risk + safer alternative.

## Dark Mode safety rule
Every Dark Mode card MUST include:
- `risk = avoid`
- `trap` (why it can escalate)
- `native_sauce` (safer alternative)
- `cultural_note` (tone + context)

## Product UI guidance
- Show packs by category (Tools / Mindset / Voice), then module, then level.
- Inside modules, list only pack title + level.
- Voice (dark / risky) requires a warning gate.

## Pack families (current)
- 📦 Tools: core words/phrases for action (survival + missions).
- 🧠 Mindset: culture-as-usage (register, norms, why natives say it that way).
- 🗣 Voice: slang, tone, native sauce, traps (risky content).
